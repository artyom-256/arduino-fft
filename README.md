# Arduino FFT

Fast fourier transformation using Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm on Anrduino.
The project consists of a sound sensor and 11 LEDs which correspond to frequencies in range of 150Hz - 1500Hz.
The input sound is splited into frequencies and an LED that corresponds to the major frequincy within this range will light up.
